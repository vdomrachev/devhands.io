I'll create an Ansible playbook that configures an Ubuntu server for maximum RPS with Nginx, including automated testing with different configurations using wrk.Now I'll create the nginx configuration templates that the playbook references:Now let me create an inventory file and usage instructions:This comprehensive Ansible playbook will:

**System Optimizations:**
- Configure kernel parameters for high network performance
- Set appropriate file descriptor limits
- Tune TCP stack settings
- Optimize memory usage

**Nginx Configurations Tested:**
1. **Baseline** - Standard configuration for comparison
2. **Optimized** - High-performance settings with increased worker connections, optimized buffers, and caching
3. **Gzip Enabled** - Tests compression impact on performance

**Performance Testing:**
- Uses `wrk` (modern HTTP benchmarking tool) for load testing
- Tests multiple connection counts (50-1000) to find optimal settings
- Measures requests per second (RPS) across different configurations
- Automatically collects and summarizes results

**Key Features:**
- Automatically installs and builds `wrk` from source
- Creates detailed performance reports
- Fetches results to your local machine for analysis
- Tests scalability across different loads
- Applies production-ready security headers

**Results Analysis:**
The playbook generates comprehensive reports showing RPS for each configuration, helping you identify the optimal settings for your specific hardware and use case.

To use this, save the playbook as `playbook.yml`, create the template files in a `templates/` directory, update the inventory with your server details, and run it. The results will show you exactly which configuration gives you the highest RPS for your Ubuntu server.
